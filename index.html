        <h2>Who are you?</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Alfred Bassett, but I go by my middle name, David. I'm a
          young (21 year old) software developer yearning to learn more! I
          currently live in Wisconsin, but I'm excited to see where Computer
          Science will take me!
        </p>
        <h2>Why do you like software?</h2>
        <p>
          When I was a kid, I really liked video games. While playing a game on
          an NES Emulator, I discovered the hex editor and had fun messing
          around with it. Being a kid, I wanted to learn more about what those
          numbers meant and how to make changes to do things. That kinda paved
          the way to where I am today.

        <h2>What exactly do you know?</h2>
        <p>
          I double-majored in Computer Science and Computer Engineering at the
          University of Wisconsin-Madison. I recently graduated this December. I
          enjoyed both practical and theoretical software as well as the actual
          hardware and circuitry used to power code. I went as high level as
          React and Python to as low level as assembly (and Verilog, if that
          counts). In terms of practical computer science, I took courses
          regarding Operating Systems, Compilers, Frontend Development, and
          Artificial Intelligence. For theoretical computer science, I took
          Discrete Math and an Algorithms Class. For hardware, I synthesized
          fpga's, simulated my own CPU hardware, designed custom PCBs, and did
          some embedded stuff on a couple of Infineon PSoC6's.
        </p>
        <h2>What's your favorite part of coding? Why do you do it?</h2>
        <p>
          Computer Science is like a treasure trove that changes and grows
          exponentially over time. I don't think any other majors are quite like
          that (besides economics, medicine, and STEM). Since I really like both
          learning and exploring new things, I seem to fit right in! It also
          helps that I really like math and science. To that point, I think I
          was one of probably 10 people in my algorithms class that actually
          enjoyed what we did!
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>
      What languages do you know / What's your preferred choice of language?
    </h2>
    <p>I know <i>quite a lot</i> of languages. Just to list a few:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>C/C++</li>
      <li>Python</li>
      <li>Java</li>
      <li>JavaScript/TypeScript</li>
      <li>HTML/CSS</li>
      <li>Rust</li>
      <li>Some Bash</li>
      <li>SQL (if that counts)</li>
      <li>...there's probably more that I'm forgetting</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I tend to think that if you understand common coding paradigms,
      programming languages come very naturally as a result.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also don't really have a favorite coding language. What I use changes
      from project to project. If I care more about performance and want to
      reduce binary size, I'll use C or C++. If I just want to write up code
      quickly and don't really care about how well the CPU runs it, I'll use
      Python. If I want to be super careful about my memory usage and don't mind
      'fighting the compiler', I'll use Rust. For frontend stuff, Svelte has
      really been growing on me. I like how it feels super simiar to vanilla
      while being around 10x as powerful (without a virtual DOM, too)!

        <h2>What are some of your projects?</h2>
        <p>
          There's been a lot of fun projects I've done. Unfortunately, I don't
          think I can legally share the source code for most of them, due to
          university and company policy. But as some examples:
        </p>

    <h2>What have you been doing recently?</h2>
    <p>
      Recently, I've been on the job hunt! Because my interests in CS are broad,
      I'm open to quite a lot, and I'm excited to see what I can learn and
      contribute to in a work environment!
    </p>
    <h2>What do you think about AI?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Coding with an AI assistant is good, if done correctly. However, I
        personally have had many more bad experiences than good with the
        technology, so I tend to rely on it very seldomly and particularly.
        While coding assistants can be really helpful at times, thinking some
        model can understand an entire codebase better than a human is
        ridiculous. It's a tool, but not an all-in-one tool. If you build a
        house with just a hammer, something will eventually go seriously wrong.
      </li>
      <li>
        Offloading any sort of learning experience to an AI defeats the purpose!
        Near the end of my CS program, some classes were encouraging us to use
        AI when coding. While I think that, if used correctly, it can clarify
        confusing topics and automate a lot of boilerplate, it can easily
        diminish the amount of information you take away from anything. You'll
        never learn anything if you never try it yourself!
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="text-image-combo">
      <div>
        <h2>What else do you like?</h2>
        <p>
          I really like high-level math and modern physics! While I didn't take
          too many classes on it in my coursework, I really like learning how
          the world around us works!
        </p>
        <p>
          I also really like tennis! I play a lot with my brother, and it's a
          great passtime when the weather is warmer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm a big fan of nature! I like walking outside a lot and taking it
          all in. I really love the wintertime, especially when it's snowing
          (which always happens in Wisconsin). It's pretty crazy how beautiful
          the earth we live on can get.
